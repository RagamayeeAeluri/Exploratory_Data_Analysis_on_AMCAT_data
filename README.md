This ppt consists of Exploratory Data Analysis done on AMCAT data.
The dataset comprises approximately 40 independent variables and 4000 data points, offering a robust foundation for analysis.
Independent variables exhibit both continuous and categorical characteristics, contributing to the richness and complexity of the dataset.
This study is primarily focused on students with engineering disciplines, aiming to uncover insights into their employment outcomes.
Key dependent variables of interest include Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations, reflecting the professional trajectories of engineering graduates.
Additionally, the dataset provides standardized scores across three critical domains: cognitive skills, technical skills, and personality traits.
Notably, demographic features are also incorporated into the dataset to enable a comprehensive analysis.

The primary aim of this project is to establish a correlation between the dataset provided by Aspiring Minds within the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) and the corresponding salary information of its participants.
